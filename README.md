# A71BOT
A bot made for Alvarro71, This was made by Alvarro71 And Miguel

We have made this with multiple uses, most of these are for a server of Alvarro71's.

*NOTE* If you are planning to reuse this in your server, you will have to follow these steps:

**1 - You will have to make a .env code in the */root* folder to save the token and client id, the names are inside the */src/server.js* script**

**2 - Dont post it on github *EXCEPT* if you decide to use a .gitignore on the .env code**

**3 - Give us credit, as we worked hard, day and night to create this bot, not inside the bot, inside the github repo, thank you**
